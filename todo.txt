-Provide executable download, use npm pkg
- Add a config.yml option: "ffmpeg" that expects a valid ffmpeg command, and runs that instead of trim-merge's generated ffmpeg command.
    -Maybe allow template strings to pass in other options defined in config.yml, such as input, output and times?
    So if the ffmpeg option is "ffmpeg {trim-start} {input} ...arbitrary ffmpeg commands {trim-end} {output} ",
    trim-merge will fill in the templated variables

    OR

    Just keep it simple and pass in the user given ffmpeg command as is.
 
- Add a cli option to only log the generated ffmpeg commands.
- Accept json or any markup language as the config file.
-add link to config.yml examples in readme
